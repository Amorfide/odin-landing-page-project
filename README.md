# odin-landing-page-project

This project, is about applying all of the knowledge I've learnt during The Odin Projects foundations course, up to the flexbox lessons, to create a landing page.
The Odin Project provides a reference image and I am to recreate it, using HTML & CSS. Images will be included in a reference folder for comparison.
